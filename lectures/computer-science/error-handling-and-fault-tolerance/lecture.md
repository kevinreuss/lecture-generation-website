# Error Handling and Fault Tolerance

Error handling and fault tolerance are critical aspects of software development that aim to ensure the stability, reliability, and resilience of applications. They involve strategies and techniques that anticipate, detect, and resolve errors while maintaining system functionality.

## Error Handling

**Error handling** is the process of responding to and resolving exceptional conditions that may occur during program execution. Exceptional conditions are situations that deviate from the normal flow of the program.

In many programming languages, including Python and Java, errors are handled using a `try/except` block. Here's a simple example in Python:

```python
try:
    print(5/0)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
```

In this code, the `try` block contains the code that might throw an error, and the `except` block contains the code that will execute if an error of the specified type occurs.

## Fault Tolerance

**Fault tolerance** is the ability of a system to continue operating correctly in the event of hardware or software failure. This often involves redundancy, error checking, and recovery procedures.

For instance, in a distributed system, redundancy can be achieved by replicating data across multiple servers. If one server fails, the system can continue to operate using the data from the remaining servers.

```python
import requests
servers = ["http://server1.com", "http://server2.com", "http://server3.com"]

for server in servers:
    try:
        response = requests.get(server)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            break
    except requests.ConnectionError:
        continue
```

In this Python example, a list of servers is iterated through until a successful response is received. If a connection error occurs with one server, the `continue` statement skips to the next iteration, effectively allowing the system to tolerate the fault and continue working.

Both error handling and fault tolerance are essential for building robust, reliable software that can withstand and recover from the unpredictable realities of production environments.
