# SIMD and MIMD Processing

`SIMD` (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) and `MIMD` (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data) are two types of parallel computing architectures.

## SIMD

In `SIMD`, a single instruction operates on multiple data points simultaneously. It's frequently used in vector and matrix operations. Modern CPUs include SIMD instruction sets such as Intel's SSE and AVX, or ARM's NEON.

Here's an example with pseudocode:

```pseudo
SIMD_Vector a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
SIMD_Vector b = {5, 6, 7, 8}
SIMD_Vector c = a + b  // {6, 8, 10, 12}
```

Each operation corresponds to a single instruction executed in parallel on multiple data points.

## MIMD

`MIMD` architecture allows multiple processors to execute different instructions on different data. It's the most utilized architecture in parallel computing, used in multiple-core processors and distributed systems.

Here's an example with pseudocode:

```pseudo
Processor_1:
    data_1 = {1, 2, 3}
    result_1 = process(data_1)  // process is a specific function

Processor_2:
    data_2 = {4, 5, 6}
    result_2 = process(data_2)
```

Each processor can execute different instructions on different data independently.

The main difference between `SIMD` and `MIMD` is that `SIMD` requires data to be in lockstep under a single instruction, whereas `MIMD` allows separate processes to run on any data independently.
