# Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipelines

CI/CD pipelines automate the software delivery process. The pipeline builds code, runs tests (CI), and safely deploys a new version of the application (CD).

## Continuous Integration

CI is a coding philosophy and set of practices that drive development teams to implement small changes and check in code to version control repositories frequently.

Example: Jenkins, a popular open-source CI server allows configuring workflows, called "pipelines". Here's a simple Jenkins pipeline script:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building..'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing..'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This script includes two stages: `Build` and `Test`. Each stage contains steps that execute commands.

## Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment follows the testing phase of the pipeline and involves automatic deployment of the code to production.

Example: In AWS, CodeDeploy is a service that automates application deployments. An `appspec.yml` file provides the deployment instructions, like so:

```yaml
version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
  - source: /
    destination: /var/www/html
hooks:
  ApplicationStop:
    - location: scripts/stop_server
  ApplicationStart:
    - location: scripts/start_server
```

This `appspec.yml` file instructs CodeDeploy to copy the files from the root directory of the source code to the `/var/www/html` directory on the instance. It also specifies scripts to be run at different stages of the deployment.

## CI/CD Benefits

CI/CD pipelines provide numerous benefits:

- **Fast feedback**: Automated builds and tests give developers quick feedback on changes they make, allowing them to address issues immediately.
- **Automated deployment**: Manual deployment processes can be error-prone and time-consuming. Automating these processes ensures consistency and saves time.
- **Continuous delivery**: With a working CI/CD pipeline, you're always ready to deploy your application. This enables a more rapid response to market changes.

Remember, CI/CD is not a tool but a cultural shift in how we develop and deliver software. While tools help us implement CI/CD, the key is the commitment to integrating and deploying code continuously.
