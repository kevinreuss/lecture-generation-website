# Semantic Versioning in Software Development

Semantic versioning, often abbreviated as SemVer, is a versioning scheme for software that aims to convey meaning about the underlying changes in a release.

A typical semantic version number has the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- `MAJOR` version increment indicates incompatible API changes.
- `MINOR` version increment indicates addition of functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
- `PATCH` version increment indicates backward-compatible bug fixes.

### Example

Consider a software package with version `2.3.5`. If a new release of the software fixes a bug without changing the software's API, the version number becomes `2.3.6`. If the release adds a new feature but doesn't alter the existing API, the version number becomes `2.4.0`. If the release modifies the API, the version number becomes `3.0.0`.

### Pre-release Versions

Semantic versioning also supports pre-release versions and build metadata. A hyphen `-` or a plus sign `+` can be added after the PATCH version.

For example, a pre-release version may look like `1.0.0-alpha` or `1.0.0-alpha.1`. Pre-release versions indicate that the version is unstable and may not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements.

Build metadata may appear like `1.0.0+20130313144700` where the build metadata (`20130313144700`) provides additional information but does not affect version precedence.

### Semantic Versioning with Git

In Git, semantic versioning can be managed using tags. Here's how to tag your commits with a semantic version:

```bash
git tag -a "v1.0.0" -m "First stable release"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will create a tag named `v1.0.0` with the message "First stable release" and push the tag to the repository.

Semantic versioning is a clear and rigid system for versioning but it's not the only one. The key is to pick a system that matches the projectâ€™s development and release cycle, and to be consistent with it.
