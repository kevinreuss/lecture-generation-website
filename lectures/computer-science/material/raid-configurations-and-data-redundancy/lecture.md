# RAID Configurations and Data Redundancy

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a technology that combines multiple physical disk drive components into a single logical unit for the purposes of data redundancy, performance improvement, or both.

## RAID Levels 
Different RAID levels offer various benefits in terms of data redundancy and performance. Here are three common levels:

### RAID 0 
RAID 0 (Striping) splits data evenly across two or more disks with no parity information for redundancy. It's intended to increase the system's performance, as multiple drives are reading and writing data simultaneously.

```python
# RAID 0 example
# Assuming disk1 and disk2 are two separate disks
data = 'RAID 0 Data'
disk1.write(data[0:len(data)//2])
disk2.write(data[len(data)//2:])
```

### RAID 1 
RAID 1 (Mirroring) duplicates the same data on two or more disks. This level provides data redundancy at the cost of reduced total capacity.

```python
# RAID 1 example
# Assuming disk1 and disk2 are two separate disks
data = 'RAID 1 Data'
disk1.write(data)
disk2.write(data)  # Same data written on disk2
```

### RAID 5 
RAID 5 (Striping with Parity) provides data striping at the byte level and also stripe error correction information. This results in excellent performance and good fault tolerance. RAID 5 requires at least 3 disks to implement.

```python
# RAID 5 example
# Assuming disk1, disk2, and disk3 are three separate disks
data = 'RAID 5 Data'
parity = compute_parity(data)
disk1.write(data[0:len(data)//3])
disk2.write(data[len(data)//3:2*len(data)//3])
disk3.write(parity)  # Parity data written on disk3
```

## Data Redundancy
Data redundancy is the duplication of data to allow the system to continue functioning in the event of hardware failure. RAID configurations like RAID 1 and RAID 5 provide data redundancy by duplicating data across multiple hard drives. If one drive fails, the system can still retrieve the data from the remaining drives. 

Keep in mind, while RAID provides data redundancy, it does not replace the need for data backup. RAID protects against hardware failure, but not against data corruption or accidental deletion.
