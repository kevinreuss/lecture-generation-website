# SIMD Vectorization in Modern CPUs

SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) vectorization is a technique employed by modern CPUs to process data in parallel, enhancing computing performance. 

A standard CPU processes data sequentially, i.e., one operation at a time. With SIMD, the CPU can perform the same operation on multiple data points concurrently. This is particularly useful in applications that involve repetitive computations on large arrays of data, such as image processing and machine learning algorithms.

## How Does SIMD Work?

Consider processing an array of integers. Traditionally, a CPU would take each integer and perform operations one by one. SIMD, however, allows the CPU to take a chunk of the array and process it in one go. This chunk is known as a vector, hence the term vectorization.

Here's a simple C++ code snippet showing how SIMD works:

```cpp
#include <immintrin.h> // for AVX

void add(int* a, int* b, int* c, int size) {
    for(int i=0; i<size; i+=8) {
        __m256i _a = _mm256_loadu_si256((__m256i*)&a[i]);
        __m256i _b = _mm256_loadu_si256((__m256i*)&b[i]);
        __m256i _c = _mm256_add_epi32(_a, _b);
        _mm256_storeu_si256((__m256i*)&c[i], _c);
    }
}
```
This code uses Intel's AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) to add two arrays of integers. Instead of adding the integers one by one, it loads 8 integers at a time into 256-bit wide registers (`__m256i`), adds them using `_mm256_add_epi32`, and stores the results back into the array. 

## SIMD in Modern CPUs

Modern CPUs support different SIMD instruction sets. Intel's CPUs, for example, have evolved from MMX to SSE, and later to AVX. Each new instruction set has introduced wider registers, allowing more data to be processed simultaneously.

However, SIMD vectorization is not automatic. It has to be explicitly coded (like in the above example) or enabled in the compiler. Some compilers, such as gcc and clang, support auto-vectorization, which automatically vectorizes loops where it would be beneficial. 

In conclusion, SIMD vectorization is a powerful tool that allows modern CPUs to process data in a highly parallel manner, significantly boosting performance for certain types of applications.
