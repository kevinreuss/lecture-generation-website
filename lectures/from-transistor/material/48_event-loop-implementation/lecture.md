# Event Loop Implementation

The Event Loop is a critical software engineering concept, especially in JavaScript. It's the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming.

## Event Loop Basics

The Event Loop's primary function is to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event from the queue and push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.

```javascript
console.log('Hello'); // First item for the call stack
setTimeout(() => { // Placed in the Web APIs and later moved to the Callback Queue
  console.log('There'); 
}, 0);
console.log('World'); // Second item for the call stack
```
In this example, the output would be "Hello", "World", "There" due to the Event Loop's nature.

## Event Loop in Node.js

Node.js is a fantastic example of the Event Loop in action. Node.js uses the libuv library to implement the Event Loop. 

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('./file.txt', () => { // Moved to Web APIs and later to the Callback Queue
  console.log('Read file'); 
});
console.log('Started reading file'); // First item for the call stack
```
Here, 'Started reading file' will output before 'Read file'.

## Microtasks and Macrotasks

The Event Loop gives priority to process.nextTick and Promises (microtasks) over other tasks (macrotasks like setTimeout, setImmediate). 

```javascript
console.log('Start'); // First item for the call stack
setTimeout(() => { console.log('setTimeout'); }, 0); // Macrotask
setImmediate(() => { console.log('setImmediate'); }); // Macrotask
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Promise')); // Microtask
process.nextTick(() => console.log('nextTick')); // Microtask
console.log('End'); // Second item for the call stack
```
This outputs: "Start", "End", "nextTick", "Promise", "setTimeout", "setImmediate". 

In conclusion, the Event Loop is a fundamental part of how JavaScript operates. A deep understanding allows for better handling of JavaScript's asynchronous nature.
