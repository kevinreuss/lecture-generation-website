# HTTP Protocol Implementation

HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a protocol for data communication. It sets rules for transmitting hypertext requests and information between server and browser.

## HTTP Request Types

HTTP offers various methods for different actions:

- **GET**: Requests data from a specified resource.
- **POST**: Sends data to a server to create/update a resource.
- **PUT**: Sends data to a server to create/update a resource.
- **DELETE**: Deletes the specified resource.

More methods exist, but these are the most common.

## HTTP Response Status Codes

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Some commonly encountered are:

- **200 OK**: The request is OK (this is the standard response for successful HTTP requests).
- **404 Not Found**: The server can't find the requested page.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error message, given when no more specific message is suitable.

## HTTP Headers

HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response. They define the operating parameters of an HTTP transaction.

For example, the `Content-Type` header field is used to specify the media type of the resource.

```
Content-Type: text/html
```

## Implementing HTTP Protocol with Node.js

Here's a simple example of a basic HTTP server using Node.js:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World');
});

server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
});
```

In the example, we require the http module, create a new HTTP server that sends 'Hello World' with a status code of 200 and a `Content-Type` of `text/plain`, and listen on port 3000.

The `http.createServer()` method turns your computer into an HTTP server. The server object listens for requests from clients and sends back responses.

## Conclusion

Understanding HTTP protocol implementation is crucial for web development. It's the foundation that allows browsers and web servers to communicate. By exploring HTTP's methods, status codes, headers, and a simple implementation with Node.js, we have a deeper understanding of this essential protocol.
