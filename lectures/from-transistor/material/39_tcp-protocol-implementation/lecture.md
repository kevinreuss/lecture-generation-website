# TCP Protocol Implementation

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a core protocol of the Internet Protocol suite. It operates at the transport layer of the OSI model, providing reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes between applications running on hosts.

## Connection Setup

A TCP connection is established by performing a 'three-way handshake'. This process begins when a client sends a SYN packet to a server. The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, and the client then sends an ACK packet back to the server. 

```python
# Pseudo code for TCP Handshake
def tcp_handshake(client, server):
    client.syn() # send SYN
    server.syn_ack() # receive SYN, send SYN-ACK
    client.ack() # receive SYN-ACK, send ACK
```

## Data Transfer 

Once a connection is established, data transfer can occur. The sender breaks up the data into TCP segments and sends them to the receiver. The receiver sends an ACK for each segment.

```python
# Pseudo code for TCP Data Transfer
def tcp_data_transfer(sender, receiver, data):
    segments = sender.segment_data(data) # segment the data
    for segment in segments:
        sender.send(segment) # send each segment
        receiver.ack(segment) # acknowledge each segment
```

## Flow Control

TCP uses a sliding window for flow control, which allows the receiver to control the rate of data transmission. The receiver specifies the window size in the ACK packet, which tells the sender how much data it can send before it must wait for an acknowledgment.

```python
# Pseudo code for TCP Flow Control
def tcp_flow_control(sender, receiver, window_size):
    while not sender.data_queue.empty():
        if sender.window < window_size:
            segment = sender.data_queue.pop() # get next segment
            sender.send(segment) # send segment
            sender.window += len(segment) # increase window size
        else:
            ack = receiver.receive() # receive ACK
            sender.window -= ack.window_size # decrease window size
```

## Connection Termination

A TCP connection is terminated through a process known as a 'four-way handshake'. This process ensures that both parties have finished transmitting all data.

```python
# Pseudo code for TCP Connection Termination
def tcp_termination(client, server):
    client.fin() # send FIN
    server.ack() # receive FIN, send ACK
    server.fin() # send FIN
    client.ack() # receive FIN, send ACK
```

In summary, TCP Protocol Implementation involves connection setup, data transfer, flow control, and connection termination. Each stage has specific mechanisms to ensure reliable and ordered data transfer.
