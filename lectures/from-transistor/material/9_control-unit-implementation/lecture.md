# Control Unit Implementation 

The Control Unit (CU) is a critical component of a computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU). It orchestrates the fetching, decoding, and execution of instructions within the CPU. There are two primary methods of implementing a control unit: Hardwired Control Units and Microprogrammed Control Units.

## Hardwired Control Units 

Hardwired Control Units are implemented directly within the hardware of the computer. They are designed using logic gates, flip-flops, and multiplexers. The logic of the control unit, including the instruction set and the micro-operations, is hardcoded into the circuitry.

Here's an example of a simple hardwired control logic circuit in VHDL:

```vhdl
entity control_unit is
  Port ( opcode : in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (2 downto 0);
         zero : in STD_LOGIC;
         control_signals : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (2 downto 0));
end control_unit;

architecture Behavioral of control_unit is
begin
  control_signals <= "010" when opcode="000" else
                    "110" when opcode="001" else
                    "001";
end behavioral;
```

This circuit has a 3-bit opcode input, and outputs a 3-bit control signal.

## Microprogrammed Control Units

Microprogrammed Control Units, on the other hand, implement the control logic as a mini-program or 'microcode' stored in control memory. Each micro-instruction in control memory corresponds to a basic operation or 'micro-operation' that can be performed by the CPU.

Here's an example of a micro-instruction for a hypothetical Microprogrammed Control Unit:

```asm
0001 0010 0110 1001
```

This 16-bit micro-instruction could represent a sequence of micro-operations, where each bit or group of bits corresponds to a different control signal.

In summary, the implementation of Control Units is a fundamental aspect of CPU design, and the choice between Hardwired and Microprogrammed designs can have a significant impact on the functionality, performance, and complexity of the CPU.
