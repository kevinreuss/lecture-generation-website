# Bootloader Implementation

A bootloader is a small program that loads and starts the main operating system on a device, typically when the device is turned on.

## Stages of a Bootloader

Bootloaders often come in stages, due to the limited space available in the booting environment.

1. **First Stage Bootloader**: Resides in a fixed, machine-specific location. It's responsible for loading the second stage bootloader. It's typically small due to storage limitations.

2. **Second Stage Bootloader**: A more complex program which is loaded by the first stage bootloader. It prepares the system and loads the main operating system.

## Bootloader Implementation Steps

Here's a basic flow of how a bootloader implementation might look:

1. **Initialization**: The bootloader initializes system hardware, like the memory controller, CPU, or any other necessary hardware.

2. **Loading**: The bootloader reads the OS kernel from a storage device into RAM.

3. **Transition**: The bootloader hands control over to the OS kernel, often providing it with some form of initial configuration.

For example, let's assume we have a simple bootloader that loads a binary image from a flash memory and executes it. Here's a simple pseudo code representation:

```c
void bootloader(void) {
    char* kernel = (char*) 0x100000; // Kernel is stored at 0x100000
    char* flash = (char*) 0x200000;  // Flash memory starts at 0x200000

    // Copy kernel from flash memory to RAM
    for(int i = 0; i < KERNEL_SIZE; i++) {
        kernel[i] = flash[i];
    }

    // Jump to the start of the kernel
    void (*entry_point)() = (void*)kernel;
    entry_point();
}
```

## Bootloader Development

Bootloader development is typically done in a mix of assembly and C, as it often requires direct hardware access and low-level programming. Debugging can be challenging, so it's important to get it right.

Remember, the bootloader is the foundation of a system's boot process. Mistakes made at this level can result in difficult-to-diagnose system-wide issues.
