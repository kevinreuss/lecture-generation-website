# Virtual Memory Implementation

Virtual memory is an abstraction of the main memory. It allows programs to be executed in a space larger than the actual physical memory, or RAM, by using disk storage as a backup.

## Paging

The first step in implementing virtual memory is to divide physical memory into fixed-size blocks, called frames, and virtual memory into blocks of the same size, called pages. When a program needs to access a memory location, it references the virtual address. The operating system translates this to a physical address.

```c
unsigned long virtual_address = 0x12345;
unsigned long page_number = virtual_address / PAGE_SIZE;
unsigned long offset = virtual_address % PAGE_SIZE;
```

## Page Tables

A page table is used to map virtual pages to physical frames. Each entry in the table contains the frame number associated with a page and flags to control access to the page (e.g., whether it's readable, writable, executable, etc.).

```c
struct page_table_entry {
    unsigned long frame_number;
    unsigned int flags;
};
```

## Page Faults

If the page table entry for a virtual page is not in physical memory (a condition known as a page fault), the operating system must swap it in from disk. This involves finding a free frame, reading the page from disk into that frame, and updating the page table.

```c
void handle_page_fault(unsigned long page_number) {
    struct page_table_entry *pte = &page_table[page_number];
    unsigned long frame_number = find_free_frame();
    read_page_from_disk(pte->frame_number, frame_number);
    pte->frame_number = frame_number;
    pte->flags |= PAGE_PRESENT;
}
```

## TLB

To speed up the translation from virtual addresses to physical addresses, a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is used. This is a small cache that stores recent translations and can be accessed much faster than the main page table.

```c
unsigned long translate_virtual_address(unsigned long virtual_address) {
    unsigned long page_number = virtual_address / PAGE_SIZE;
    unsigned long offset = virtual_address % PAGE_SIZE;
    struct tlb_entry *entry = lookup_tlb(page_number);
    if (entry) {
        return (entry->frame_number * PAGE_SIZE) + offset;
    } else {
        struct page_table_entry *pte = &page_table[page_number];
        add_to_tlb(pte->frame_number, page_number);
        return (pte->frame_number * PAGE_SIZE) + offset;
    }
}
```
This is a brief overview of how virtual memory is implemented at a high level. It's a complex system that involves many other components, such as the CPU, the operating system, and the disk subsystem.
