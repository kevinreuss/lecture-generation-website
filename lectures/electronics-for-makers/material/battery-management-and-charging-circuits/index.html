# Battery Management and Charging Circuits

Battery management systems (BMS) are crucial in the world of electronics, specifically for rechargeable batteries. They manage a battery's charging and discharging process, monitor its condition, calculate secondary data, report that data, authenticate it, and / or balance it.

A typical charging circuit involves a few key components:

- **Power source**: This is the source from which the battery draws power. It could be a solar panel, an AC adapter, or any other power source.

- **Regulator**: This component regulates the power from the source to the required level.

- **Microcontroller**: This controls the entire charging process. It takes input from the temperature sensor and the current sensing circuit, and adjusts the charging process accordingly.

- **Current sensing circuit**: This circuit measures the current going into the battery.

- **Temperature sensor**: This sensor monitors the battery temperature to prevent overheating.

Let's consider a simple example of a Li-ion battery charging circuit. 

Li-ion batteries are charged using a constant current/constant voltage (CC/CV) protocol. The charging process involves two stages:

1. **Constant current stage**: The battery is charged at the maximum charging rate. When the battery voltage reaches the threshold voltage, this stage ends.

2. **Constant voltage stage**: The charger switches mode and applies a voltage equal to the maximum battery voltage. The current gradually drops as the battery approaches full charge.

Here's a simple pseudo code for the microcontroller:

```python
def charge_battery():
    while battery_not_full():
        if battery_voltage() < threshold_voltage:
            charge_constant_current()
        else:
            charge_constant_voltage()

        if battery_temperature() > max_temperature:
            pause_charging()
        else:
            continue_charging()
```

In this pseudo code, the battery is charged at a constant current until it reaches a certain threshold voltage. After that, the charger switches to a constant voltage mode. The charging is paused if the battery temperature exceeds a certain limit.

Remember, this is a simplified representation. Real-world BMS are complex and involve more safety features and protocols.
