# Introduction to Signal Conditioning

Signal conditioning refers to the process of modifying a signal in a way that it can be properly read by other devices or sensors. It involves various techniques such as filtering, amplifying, linearizing, and converting that help in preparing a signal to be processed.

## Amplification

Amplification is a crucial aspect of signal conditioning. It's the process of increasing the magnitude of the signal making it suitable for further processing. For example, a thermocouple produces a very low voltage which would be difficult to measure directly. We can use an amplifier to increase the voltage level.

## Filtering

Not all parts of a signal may be useful. Filtering helps remove unwanted frequencies from the signal. For example, a low-pass filter can be used to remove high-frequency noise from a signal.

## Linearization

Some sensors produce non-linear output. Linearization is the process of converting this non-linear output into a linear form. This simplifies further processing and analysis of the signal.

## Conversion

Signals may need to be converted from one form to another for various reasons, such as compatibility with other equipment or processing requirements. The most common conversion is Analog-to-Digital (ADC) and Digital-to-Analog (DAC).

ADC example using Arduino:

```c++
// Define input analog pin
const int analogInPin = A0;  

void setup() {
  // Begin serial communication at 9600 baud
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // Read the analog value of the pin
  int sensorValue = analogRead(analogInPin);  

  // Print the value to the serial monitor
  Serial.println(sensorValue);

  // Wait for 1 second to see the changes
  delay(1000);                      
}
```

In this example, the Arduino reads the analog input and converts it into a digital value which is then printed out to the serial monitor.

Remember, signal conditioning is vital to ensure our signals are prepared correctly for further processing or transmission. It enables efficient and accurate data extraction from complex or noisy signals.
