# Introduction to Audio Components

Audio components are integral parts of any multimedia system, enabling the processing and playback of sound. 

## Digital Audio Signal

A digital audio signal is a binary representation of an analog audio signal. It's generated by sampling the analog signal at regular intervals, typically 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz. Each sample is then quantized into a binary value.

Consider the Python code snippet below, which uses the `wave` module to read a WAV file, a common container for digital audio signals:

```python
import wave

# Open a wave file
wav_file = wave.open('sample.wav', 'r')

# Get parameters
num_channels = wav_file.getnchannels()
sample_width = wav_file.getsampwidth()
frame_rate = wav_file.getframerate()

# Read frames
frames = wav_file.readframes(wav_file.getnframes())
```

## Audio Codecs

An audio codec is a program that encodes or decodes a digital audio signal. Common audio codecs include MP3, AAC, and FLAC.

Here's a Python snippet that uses the `pydub` module to convert a WAV file to MP3:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load a wave file
audio = AudioSegment.from_wav('sample.wav')

# Export as MP3
audio.export('sample.mp3', format='mp3')
```

## Audio Devices

Audio devices are hardware components that generate or capture audio signals. In software, they're represented by APIs that provide access to their functionality.

For example, the `sounddevice` module in Python allows streaming audio to and from audio devices:

```python
import sounddevice as sd
import numpy as np

# Generate a 440 Hz sine wave
fs = 44100  # Sampling frequency
f = 440  # Frequency
t = np.arange(fs) / fs
signal = 0.5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * f * t)

# Play the sine wave
sd.play(signal, fs)
```

This code generates a 440 Hz sine wave, which is a typical tuning pitch in music, and plays it back using the default audio device.

## Audio Processing

Audio processing involves manipulating an audio signal to achieve a desired effect. Common audio processing techniques include filtering, reverb, and pitch shifting.

For example, the `scipy` module in Python can be used to apply a high-pass filter to an audio signal:

```python
from scipy.signal import butter, lfilter

# Define a high-pass filter
def highpass(cutoff, fs, order=5):
    nyq = 0.5 * fs
    normal_cutoff = cutoff / nyq
    b, a = butter(order, normal_cutoff, btype='high', analog=False)
    return b, a

# Apply the filter
b, a = highpass(1000, fs)
filtered_signal = lfilter(b, a, signal)
```

This code defines and applies a high-pass filter that removes frequencies below 1000 Hz from the signal.
