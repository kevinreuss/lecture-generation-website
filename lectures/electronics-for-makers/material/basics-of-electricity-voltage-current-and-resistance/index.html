# Basics of Electricity: Voltage, Current, and Resistance

## Voltage
Voltage, denoted as 'V', is the electrical force that moves electrons. It's measured in volts (V). High voltage can push a large amount of current.

```python
Voltage = Work / Charge
```
This equation demonstrates that voltage is the work done (energy transferred) per unit charge.

## Current
Current, denoted as 'I', is the rate at which charge is flowing. It's measured in amperes (A). High current implies more electricity is flowing.

```python
Current = Charge / Time
```
This equation shows that current is the amount of charge (in Coulombs) flowing through a point in a unit of time.

## Resistance
Resistance, denoted as 'R', is the opposition to the flow of current. It's measured in ohms (Ω). High resistance means less electricity will flow.

```python
Resistance = Voltage / Current
```
This is Ohm's Law. It defines resistance as the ratio of voltage to current.

### Example: A Simple Circuit
Imagine a simple circuit with a 9V battery and a resistor of 3Ω. The current can be calculated using Ohm's Law.

```python
Voltage = 9  # in volts
Resistance = 3  # in ohms
Current = Voltage / Resistance  # Ohm's Law
print(Current)  # prints: 3.0
```
This example shows that when applying a voltage of 9V across a 3Ω resistor, a current of 3A flows through the circuit.

In summary, understanding voltage, current, and resistance is essential for working with electric circuits. They are interconnected through Ohm's Law, which is fundamental to the analysis and design of any electrical or electronic system.
