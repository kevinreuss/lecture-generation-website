# Introduction to Wearable Electronics

Wearable electronics, also known as wearable technology, are smart electronic devices that can be incorporated into clothing or worn on the body as accessories.

## Concepts of Wearable Electronics

Wearables operate on a variety of platforms and technologies. Commonly, they use **microcontrollers**, which are small, low-cost computers on a single integrated circuit (IC). An example is the **Arduino** microcontroller. They are programmable, which means you can tailor their functionality to your specific wearable project. 

For instance, you may want to create a wearable that tracks heart rate. An Arduino can be programmed to interface with a heart rate sensor and collect data, which can then be processed or sent to another device.

```python
# Example Arduino code to read heart rate data
int sensorPin = A0; 
int sensorValue = 0; 

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  delay(1); 
}
```

This simple Arduino code reads data from a heart rate sensor connected to the analog pin A0 and prints the values to the serial monitor.

Wearables also make extensive use of wireless communication technologies, like **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** or **Zigbee**. These allow the wearable to communicate with other devices, such as a smartphone or computer, or even other wearables.

## Powering Wearable Electronics

Power consumption is a critical consideration in wearable electronics. Battery life directly impacts the user experience. Techniques for power management include using low-power components, optimizing code for efficiency, and implementing power-saving modes.

In conclusion, wearable electronics is a rapidly evolving field, combining a variety of disciplines from software engineering to fashion. The development of wearables involves understanding of microcontrollers, wireless communication, and power management.
