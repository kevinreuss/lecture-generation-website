# Introduction to GPS and Navigation Modules

GPS (Global Positioning System) is a satellite-based navigation system, which provides real-time position and velocity information. A GPS receiver receives signals from multiple GPS satellites and processes these signals to triangulate the receiver's exact location.

In the realm of software engineering, GPS data is often incorporated into applications to provide geolocation, mapping, and navigation features. These functionalities are facilitated through GPS modules - hardware devices that communicate with GPS satellites to receive location data.

## How GPS Modules Work

GPS modules, like the popular NEO-6M, interact with GPS satellites using a process called trilateration. By knowing the distance to at least three satellites, the module can compute its exact position. 

The GPS module communicates with a microcontroller (like an Arduino or Raspberry Pi) using serial communication. The NMEA (National Marine Electronics Association) protocol is typically used for this, which transmits data as ASCII sentences.

## Reading GPS Data

Here's an example of a Python script that uses the pySerial library to read NMEA sentences from a GPS module connected to a Raspberry Pi:

```python
import serial

# Set up the serial line
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/serial0', 9600)

# Read and decode the GPS data
while True:
    data = ser.readline().decode('ascii', errors='replace')
    if data[0:6] == "$GPGGA":
        print(data)
```

This script reads data from the serial port and prints out the GPGGA sentences, which contain the essential fix data, including 3D location and accuracy data.

## Parsing GPS Data

NMEA sentences can be parsed to extract useful data. For example, the pynmea2 library in Python can be used to parse the latitude and longitude from a GPGGA sentence:

```python
import pynmea2

# Parse an example GPGGA sentence
msg = pynmea2.parse("$GPGGA,123519,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,1,08,0.9,545.4,M,46.9,M,,*47")

print(f"Latitude: {msg.latitude}, Longitude: {msg.longitude}")
```

In conclusion, GPS and navigation modules provide a powerful means of adding geolocation and navigation capabilities to your software applications. By understanding how to interact with these modules and parse their data, you can create a wide range of GPS-enabled applications.
